# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to determine, within a very large corporation (Pewlett Hackard) which has a register of almost half a million employees that have been in the corporation at some time, the current employees who are about to retire.

In a large corporation such as this one, massive employee retirement over a short period of time, is nost likely to produce many operational problems within the company, and replacements need to be found, trained and mentored into their new positions.

This repository contains a progreSQL script that allows an easy navigation through the company's many human resources databases, in order to determine employees who will be retiring soon, their job titles, and critical management positions. Also, a group of retiring employees can be offered to participate in a part time role as mentors of employees that can take over their positions, in order to secure the future operation of the company, with key promotions within the company and in-house training for their future roles.

The information obtained through the SQL script can be found in the four CSV files enclosed in this repository.

## Results

 - The total number of current employees eligible for retirement is 72, 458 employees.
 - Since many employees aproaching retiring age, have been part of the company for many years, with several promotions throughout their carreers, the most recent job title for the retiring employees had to be obtained, in order to search for the appropriate job candidates. The number of unique job titles is detailed below.
